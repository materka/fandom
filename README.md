## ðŸ’€ This Library is archived and dead ðŸ’€
The Wikia API V1 lost its documentation following the [UCP](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Unified_Community_Platform) update. Some of the endpoints disappeared without notice throughout the years and, generally, it seems that Wikia API is no longer supported.

A library for Fandom [APIv1][api] (formerly known as Wikia) interaction, which makes it easy to access data from specified fandom URL

## Usage
One only need to provide a Fandom URL and a callback method which will take a complete Fandom API URL, and return a json
response. With this approach the library is fully http client agnostic, so you may use any http client library you like
for requests.

Using http library:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:fandom/src/fandom.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> main() async {
  var fandom = Fandom('https://marvel.fandom.com',
      (path) => http.get(path).then((value) => json.decode(value.body)));
  var result = await fandom.search.list('Wolverine');
  print('result: ${result.items.first.snippet}');
}
```

Using Dio library:
```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:fandom/src/fandom.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  var fandom = Fandom('https://marvel.fandom.com',
      (path) => Dio().get(path).then((value) => value.data));
  var result = await fandom.search.list('Wolverine');
  print('result: ${result.items.first.snippet}');
}
```

## Documentation

One should be able to read the Fandom [APIv1][api] documentation, to get the general gist on how to use the library.

### Disclaimer
The API documentation is not exactly up to date with what is actually returned in a response. So the library may use other types for instance members than what is stated in API documentation, and some members are missing and some new ones are not in the API documentation. IÂ´ve done my best to weed out most of the pecularities...

### Some differences between library and API
Some model names differ between API documentation and library, due to desire of having the model naming
convention consistent in the library. 

#### Resource 'Search Suggestions' 
Merged into resource 'Search'

#### Resource 'Navigation'
WikiaItem -> WikiaInfo\
Wikia -> NavigationLink\

#### Resource 'User'
UserElement -> User\
UserQueryResultItem -> UserQuery\

#### Resource 'Search'
LocalWikiSearchResult -> LocalWikiSearch\
